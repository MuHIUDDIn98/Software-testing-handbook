# 📊 Project vs. Product

Understanding the difference between a **Project** and a **Product** is essential in software development:

---

## 📁 Project

- ✅ Developed for a **specific customer**
- 📝 Based on **custom requirements**
- ⏳ Has a defined **start and end date**
- 🎯 Goal: Deliver a **tailored solution**

---

## 📦 Product

- 🌍 Developed for **multiple customers**
- 📈 Based on **market needs**
- 🔄 Ongoing development and updates
- 🎯 Goal: Deliver a **general-purpose solution**

---

> In short:  
> **Projects** are custom-built.  
> **Products** are market-driven.
