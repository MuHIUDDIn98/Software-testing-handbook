# 🧪 Static vs. Dynamic Testing

Software testing is broadly classified into two approaches: **Static Testing** and **Dynamic Testing**. Both serve different purposes in ensuring software quality.

## 📝 Static Testing

Static testing is performed **without executing the code**. It involves checking project artifacts like requirements, design, and code to detect errors early.

### 🔹 Techniques of Static Testing

#### 📋 Reviews
- Examines documents for correctness and completeness.
- Types: Requirement Reviews, Design Reviews, Code Reviews, Test Plan and Test Case Reviews.

#### 👥 Walkthroughs
- Informal session where the author explains documents or code to peers.
- Not pre-scheduled and no formal meeting records are kept.

#### ✅ Inspections
- Most formal type of review.
- Involves 3–8 participants (reader, writer, moderator).
- Scheduled and documented formally (usually via email).

## 🧪 Dynamic Testing

Dynamic testing involves **executing the actual software** with inputs and observing the outputs to identify defects.

### 🔹 Techniques of Dynamic Testing

#### 🔧 Unit Testing
- Tests individual components or functions in isolation.

#### 🔗 Integration Testing
- Verifies interactions between integrated modules or systems.

#### 🖥️ System Testing
- Validates the complete system against functional and non-functional requirements.

#### 🙋 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Performed by end-users to ensure the software meets business needs and expectations.

> ✅ **Static Testing** is proactive — it prevents defects.  
> ✅ **Dynamic Testing** is reactive — it finds defects.
