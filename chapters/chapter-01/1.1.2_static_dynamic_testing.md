# 🧪 Static vs. Dynamic Testing

Understanding when and why to use **Static** and **Dynamic** testing is crucial for ensuring software quality throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

---

## 🔍 What is Static Testing?

**Static Testing** involves reviewing and analyzing work products (like documents or code) **without executing the program**.

### ✅ When to Perform:
- **During Requirements, Design, and Coding phases**

### 🎯 Purpose:
- To find and prevent defects early
- Reduce the cost and effort of fixing bugs later

### 🛠️ Activities:
- Requirement Reviews
- Design Document Reviews
- Code Reviews
- Static Code Analysis (e.g., using linters)

---

## 🚀 What is Dynamic Testing?

**Dynamic Testing** involves **executing the code** to check the actual behavior of the software.

### ✅ When to Perform:
- **After development**, during the Testing phase

### 🎯 Purpose:
- To validate functional and non-functional behavior
- To find runtime defects

### 🛠️ Activities:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Performance & Security Testing

## 🆚 Key Differences

| **Aspect**              | **Static Testing**                            | **Dynamic Testing**                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**           | No code execution                             | Involves code execution                      |
| **Focus**               | Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs            | Functional behavior during runtime           |
| **Timing**              | Early stage of development                    | After code is developed                      |
| **Tools Example**       | Linters, code analyzers                       | Selenium, JUnit, Appium                      |
| **Objective**           | Find defects without running the software     | Detect defects by executing the software     |

| **Phase**                | **Testing Type**      | **Activity**                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Requirements Analysis    | Static Testing         | Requirement Review                   |
| Design                   | Static Testing         | Design Review                        |
| Coding                   | Static Testing         | Code Review, Static Analysis         |
| Post-Development         | Dynamic Testing        | Unit, Integration, System, UAT       |

## 🧠 Final Tip

> **"Shift Left"** – Start with **Static Testing early** to prevent bugs,  
> then use **Dynamic Testing** to ensure everything works as expected at runtime.
