## 1.10 Test Levels: Building Quality Layer by Layer üß±

Testing isn't a single event; it happens at different stages, or levels, each with its own focus. Think of it like building a house ‚Äì you check the foundation, then the walls, then the systems (plumbing, electrics), and finally, the finished house.

### 1.10.1 Component Testing (Unit Testing) üß©

**What:** Testing individual software components or modules in isolation. This is often done by developers.

**Focus:** Functionality within the component, code structure, data handling.

**Test Basis:** Detailed design, code, data models.

**Goal:** Ensure each individual piece works correctly before it's combined with others.

**Example:** Testing a single function that calculates tax in an e-commerce app.

### 1.10.2 Integration Testing ü§ù

**What:** Testing the interfaces and interactions between components or systems.

**Focus:** How well different parts communicate and work together. Can be component integration (within one system) or system integration (between different systems).

**Test Basis:** Software & system design, architecture, workflows.

**Goal:** Find issues in the handoffs and data flow between integrated parts.

**Example:** Testing if the "Add to Cart" component correctly updates the "Shopping Cart" component and the "Inventory" system.

---

### 1.10.3 System Testing üåê

**What:** Testing the entire, integrated system as a whole.

**Focus:** Overall end-to-end behavior, functionality, and non-functional aspects (like performance, security) from the perspective of the system requirements.

**Test Basis:** System requirements, functional specifications, user manuals.

**Goal:** Verify that the complete system meets its specified requirements and works as expected in its intended (or simulated) environment.

**Example:** Testing the entire e-commerce website, from searching for a product to adding it to the cart, checking out, and receiving an order confirmation.

### 1.10.4 Acceptance Testing (UAT) ‚úÖ

**What:** Formal testing, often by users or customers, to determine if the system satisfies its acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

**Focus:** Whether the system is "fit for purpose" and meets business or user needs.

**Test Basis:** User requirements, business processes, acceptance criteria.

**Goal:** Gain confidence that the system is ready for use and to make the "go/no-go" decision.

**Types:**
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** By business users.
* **Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT):** By operations/systems admin.
* **Contractual/Regulatory Acceptance Testing:** Checking against contracts or regulations.
* **Alpha Testing:** Internal testing by a limited group before release.
* **Beta Testing:** External testing by a wider audience before full release.

**Example:** Having actual customers try to purchase items on the new e-commerce site before it goes live to the public.
