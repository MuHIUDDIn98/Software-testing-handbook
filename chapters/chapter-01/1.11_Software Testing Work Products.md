## 1.11 Software Testing Work Products

This document provides an overview of the key work products (outputs) generated during the software testing lifecycle.

### 1.11.1 What is a Test Work Product?

A **Test Work Product** is any tangible document or artifact created during a specific testing activity. These documents serve as a record of the testing process, from planning to completion, ensuring clarity, traceability, and communication among team members and stakeholders.

### 1.11.2 Summary of Activities and Work Products

The following table maps core testing activities to their primary work products.

| Activity                    | Work Products                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Planning** | Test Plans                                            |
| **Test Monitoring & Control** | Test Progress/Summary Reports                         |
| **Test Analysis** | Test Conditions – Test Charters                       |
| **Test Design** | Test Cases – Test Data                                |
| **Test Implementation** | Test Procedures – Test Suites – Test Execution Schedule |
| **Test Execution** | Status of Test Cases – Defect Reports                 |
| **Test Completion** | Test Summary Report – Change Requests                 |

### 1.11.3 Key Work Products Explained

Here is a brief explanation of each major work product.

#### 1.11.3.1 Test Plan
* **What it is:** A high-level document that outlines the entire testing strategy.
* **Purpose:** Defines the scope, objectives, schedule, resources, and risks associated with testing. It's the master guide for the testing effort.

#### 1.11.3.2 Test Progress Report
* **What it is:** A regular status update on testing activities.
* **Purpose:** To inform stakeholders about how testing is proceeding against the plan, including metrics like tests passed, failed, or blocked.

#### 1.11.3.3 Test Conditions / Test Charters
* **What it is:** A high-level list or description of what needs to be tested (e.g., "Test user login functionality"). A Test Charter is a more detailed scope for an exploratory testing session.
* **Purpose:** To identify and document the features, requirements, or risks that need to be validated.

#### 1.11.3.4 Test Case & Test Data
* **What it is:** A **Test Case** contains specific, step-by-step instructions for executing a test. **Test Data** is the specific input used for that test.
* **Purpose:** To provide clear instructions for a tester to follow to verify a specific functionality and ensure consistent, repeatable tests.

#### 1.11.3.5 Test Suite & Execution Schedule
* **What it is:** A **Test Suite** is a collection of related test cases grouped together. The **Execution Schedule** defines when and in what order these suites will be run.
* **Purpose:** To organize tests logically (e.g., by feature or type) and to plan the execution phase efficiently.

#### 1.11.3.6 Defect (Bug) Report
* **What it is:** A formal document created when a test fails or unexpected behavior is found.
* **Purpose:** To provide developers with all the necessary information to find, understand, and fix the bug, including steps to reproduce it, screenshots, and expected vs. actual results.

#### 1.11.3.7 Test Summary Report
* **What it is:** A document created at the end of a testing cycle.
* **Purpose:** To summarize the entire testing effort, including key findings, final metrics, overall quality assessment, and a recommendation on whether the software is ready for release.
