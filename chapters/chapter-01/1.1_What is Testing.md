## 1.1 What is Testing? 🧐

* **Core Goals:** Testing is all about **assessing software quality** and **reducing the risk** of it failing when people actually use it.
* **More than Execution:** It's a whole **process**, not just *running* tests. It includes planning, designing, executing, and analyzing.
* **Key Focus:** It involves both:
    * **Verification:** Checking if we built it according to the specs.
    * **Validation:** Checking if it meets the user's actual needs.
* **Beyond Bugs:** It's also about **building confidence** and **preventing** issues early on!
* **Scope:** Testing not only focuses on **Verification** (of requirements, user stories, etc.) but also involves **Validation** (checking if the system meets user/stakeholder needs).

### 1.1.1 Typical Objectives of Testing 🎯

Testing isn't just one thing; it's a mission with multiple, vital objectives!
* **📄 Evaluate Work Products:** Checking all development outputs (docs, code, etc.) for quality.
* **✅ Fulfill Requirements:** Confirming the software meets specified needs.
* **👍 Build Confidence:** Giving stakeholders assurance the software works.
* **🛡️ Prevent Defects:** Getting involved early to stop bugs before they happen.
* **🐞 Find Failures & Defects:** Actively hunting for flaws and errors.
* **📊 Provide Information for Decision-Making:** Giving stakeholders data for smart choices.
* **📉 Reduce the Level of Risk:** Lowering the chance of failure in production.
* **⚖️ Ensure Compliance:** Meeting legal, contractual, and industry standards.
