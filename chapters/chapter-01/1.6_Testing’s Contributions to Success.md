## 1.6 Testing’s Contributions to Success 🏆

Testing isn't just about finding bugs at the end; it's a vital partner in success throughout the development lifecycle! Here’s how early and continuous tester involvement makes a huge difference:

* **🤝 Testers + Requirements/User Stories:**
    * When testers participate in requirements reviews, they bring a unique perspective, helping to identify and remove defects (like ambiguity or untestable points) **before** any code is written. This dramatically **reduces the risk** of developing incorrect or untestable features.

* **🧠 Testers + System Designers:**
    * Close collaboration between testers and designers fosters a shared understanding. This early insight **lowers the risk** of fundamental design flaws and allows for the **identification and planning of tests** much earlier in the process.

* **💻 Testers + Developers:**
    * When testers work closely with developers during coding, it creates a powerful feedback loop. This shared understanding **reduces the risk of defects** appearing in both the code itself and the tests designed for it.

* **✅ Testers + Pre-Release Verification & Validation:**
    * As the crucial final quality check, testers verifying and validating the software before release provides essential assurance. This **increases the likelihood** that the software truly meets stakeholder needs and satisfies all requirements, paving the way for a successful launch.

**In short:** Involving testers early and often is key to building quality in, reducing risk, and ensuring the final product is a success!
