## 1.7 Quality Assurance (QA) vs. Quality Control (QC) & Testing ðŸ“ˆ

Understanding how Testing fits within the broader scope of Quality Management is key.

**Quality Management** ensures an organization consistently delivers quality. It achieves this through two key functions: **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Quality Control (QC)**.

**Quality Assurance (QA)** is fundamentally concerned with **processes and prevention**. It sets up the rules, standards, and procedures that, when followed, should lead to high-quality outputs. Think of it as designing a perfect recipe and kitchen setup to ensure every cake *should* turn out great. By focusing on *how* work is done, QA aims to prevent defects from being introduced in the first place.

**Quality Control (QC)**, on the other hand, deals with **activities and detection**. It involves checking the actual products as they are being built or when they are finished to see if they meet the standards. **Testing is a core component of QC**. It's like tasting the cake (or parts of it) during and after baking to make sure it *actually* tastes great and meets the quality goals. QC helps find defects and provides feedback.

While distinct, QA and QC work together: QA tries to ensure defects don't happen, and QC makes sure that if they *do* happen, they are found.

### Detailed Breakdown:

#### Quality Assurance (QA): The Process Focus (Prevention)

* **What it is:** QA is primarily focused on **adherence to proper processes**.
* **How it works:** It establishes standards, procedures, and guidelines for development.
* **The Goal:** The aim is **defect prevention**. By ensuring everyone follows well-defined, quality-driven processes, QA increases the likelihood that work products will be of higher quality from the start.
    * `Good Process â†’ High-Quality Work Products â†’ Fewer Defects`

#### Quality Control (QC): The Activity Focus (Detection)

* **What it is:** QC involves various activities designed to **support the achievement of quality levels**.
* **How it works:** It involves *checking* the actual work products and deliverables.
* **The Goal:** To **identify defects** and ensure the final product meets the defined quality standards.
* **Testing's Role:** **Testing is a primary activity within Quality Control.**

**In essence:** QA builds the framework to *prevent* problems, while QC (including Testing) *finds* problems within that framework, both working together to achieve overall quality.
