# 📘 Use Case, Test Scenario & Test Case

Understanding the relationship between **Use Cases**, **Test Scenarios**, and **Test Cases** is essential for effective test planning and execution.

## 📌 Use Case

A **Use Case** describes a functional requirement of the system from the user's perspective. It helps define how users interact with the system to achieve a specific goal.

### 🔑 Key Elements:
- **Actor**: The user (person, group, or external system) interacting with the system.
- **Action**: The steps or activities performed by the actor to interact with the system.
- **Goal/Outcome**: The expected result after the actor completes the interaction.

### 🧾 Example:
> **Use Case**: "User logs into the system"
- **Actor**: Registered User
- **Action**: Enters username and password, clicks "Login"
- **Goal/Outcome**: User is redirected to the dashboard

---
## 📌 Use Case: **Buy a Product**

- **Actor**: Customer  
- **Goal**: Purchase a specific product on the website.

---

## 🔄 Steps / Flow of Events:

1. Browse the product catalog.
2. Select a product and add it to the shopping cart.
3. Proceed to checkout.
4. Enter shipping and payment information.
5. Place the order.
6. Receive order confirmation and tracking information.

---

## ✅ Outcome:

The customer successfully places an order and receives confirmation and tracking details.

---

## 🎯 Test Scenario

A **Test Scenario** is a high-level idea of what to test. It represents a possible use case or feature that needs to be verified.

### 🧾 Example:
> **Test Scenario**: Verify that the user can log in with valid credentials.

## 🧪 Test Case

A **Test Case** is a detailed, step-by-step instruction set used to verify a specific functionality of the application. It includes test data, steps, expected results, and actual results.

### ✍️ A typical Test Case contains:
- **Test Case ID**
- **Title/Description**
- **Preconditions**
- **Test Steps**
- **Test Data**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result**
- **Status** (Pass/Fail)
- **Remarks/Comments**

### 🧾 Example:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Case ID** | TC001 |
| **Title** | Verify login with valid credentials |
| **Preconditions** | User is registered in the system |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Open login page <br> 2. Enter valid username and password <br> 3. Click Login |
| **Test Data** | Username: user123 <br> Password: pass123 |
