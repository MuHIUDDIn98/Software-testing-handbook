# 📋 Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a key QA document that links **requirements** to their corresponding **test cases**. It helps ensure:
- All requirements are covered by test cases
- Complete test coverage
- Easy traceability of testing status against requirements

## 🔑 Key Components of RTM

| **Field**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Requirement ID**   | Unique identifier for each requirement                                          |
| **Requirement Description** | Describes the expected functionality or behavior from the system          |
| **Test Case IDs**    | One or more test cases that validate/verify the associated requirement          |

## 📑 RTM Example

| **Requirement ID** | **Requirement Description**                      | **Test Case IDs**   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| REQ001             | User should be able to log in                    | TC001, TC002        |
| REQ002             | System should display product details            | TC003, TC004        |
| REQ003             | User can add items to the shopping cart          | TC005, TC006        |

📌 **Benefits of RTM**:
- Ensures **full coverage** of all specified requirements
- Helps identify **missing test cases**
- Improves **transparency and accountability**
- Useful for **impact analysis** when requirements change
