# 🧪 Test Environment (Test Bed) & Test Execution

---

## 🛠️ Test Environment / Test Bed

The **Test Environment** is a configured hardware and software setup where testers execute test cases. It mimics the production environment as closely as possible to validate the behavior of the application in a real-world-like setting.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- The test environment is a **dedicated platform** for testing software.
- It includes:
  - Required operating system(s)
  - Application servers
  - Database servers
  - Network configurations
  - Browsers/devices (if needed)
- It is also known as a **Test Bed**.
- Helps in identifying environment-specific bugs.

## ▶️ Test Execution

Test Execution is the process of executing test cases and comparing the actual results with the expected results.

### 🔹 Activities Involved:
- Execute test cases based on the **Test Plan**.
- Update test case **status**: `Passed`, `Failed`, `Blocked`, `Not Run`, etc.
- **Document results** and log **defects** for failed test cases.
- Assign **bug IDs** to failed or blocked test cases.
- **Retest** the failed test cases after bug fixes.
- Track **defects until closure**.

## 📌 Guidelines for Test Execution

1. The **build** deployed to the QA environment is critical and should be validated before testing begins.
2. Test execution should be carried out in the **Quality Assurance (QA) environment** only.
3. Typically, test execution happens in **multiple cycles** (Test Cycle 1, Regression Cycle, etc.).
4. Test Execution involves:
   - Executing **manual test cases**
   - Running **automated test scripts**, if available
5. Maintain logs for all execution activities for reporting and traceability.

📎 *Properly configured test environments and disciplined execution practices ensure accurate results, reduce risks, and improve product quality.*
