## 1.9 The Fundamental Test Process ‚öôÔ∏è

While specific implementations vary (especially in Agile), most testing follows a core process with distinct phases. Understanding these helps structure testing activities.

---

### 1.9.1 Test Planning üìÖ

**What:** Defining the objectives, scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing. This phase sets the stage for all subsequent testing activities.

**Key Activities:**
* Performing risk analysis to identify potential issues and prioritize testing.
* Estimating the effort, time, and cost required for testing.
* Defining the different levels of testing (e.g., unit, integration, system) and the criteria for starting (entry) and finishing (exit) each level.
* Allocating necessary resources (people, tools, environments).

**Output:**
* **Test Plan:** A formal document outlining the entire testing strategy.

---

### 1.9.2 Test Monitoring & Control üìä

**What:** Ongoing comparison of actual progress against the plan and taking corrective actions when deviations occur. This ensures testing stays on track.

**Key Activities:**
* Measuring progress using metrics (e.g., number of test cases run, defects found and fixed, test coverage).
* Reporting the status of testing activities to stakeholders.
* Adjusting the test plan or activities based on progress, risks, and changes.

**Output:**
* **Test Progress Reports:** Regular updates on testing status.
* **Updated Test Plan:** Revisions to the original plan as needed.

---

### 1.9.3 Test Analysis üßê

**What:** Analyzing the "test basis" ‚Äì the documents and information that testing is based on (like requirements, designs, user stories, code) ‚Äì to identify *what* needs to be tested.

**Key Activities:**
* Identifying the features, functions, and attributes to be tested.
* Defining specific test conditions based on the analysis.
* Reviewing requirements and other documentation for clarity, completeness, and testability.

**Output:**
* **Defined & Prioritized Test Conditions:** A list of items/conditions to be tested, often ranked by importance or risk.

---

### 1.9.4 Test Design ‚úçÔ∏è

**What:** Designing *how* to test the conditions identified during analysis. This involves creating the high-level structure of the tests.

**Key Activities:**
* Creating high-level test cases that outline the steps to test a specific condition.
* Identifying the specific test data needed to execute these cases.
* Designing the setup required for the test environment.

**Output:**
* **Test Cases (often high-level):** Descriptions of what will be tested and how.
* **Test Data Requirements:** Specifications for the data needed.
* **Test Environment Specs:** Details about the required hardware, software, and network configurations.

---

### 1.9.5 Test Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

**What:** Getting everything ready to run the tests. This involves creating the detailed test assets.

**Key Activities:**
* Developing detailed test scripts (for manual execution) or automating test cases (for automated execution).
* Creating or acquiring the actual test data.
* Setting up and configuring the test environment according to the specifications.

**Output:**
* **Ready-to-run Test Scripts:** Detailed steps for execution.
* **Test Data:** The actual data sets to be used.
* **Configured Test Environment:** The operational environment for testing.

---

### 1.9.6 Test Execution üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

**What:** Running the tests according to the plan and design and recording the outcomes.

**Key Activities:**
* Executing the prepared test scripts (manually or via automation tools).
* Logging the results of each test (pass, fail, blocked).
* Reporting defects when the actual results do not match the expected results, providing detailed information for developers.

**Output:**
* **Test Execution Logs:** Records of which tests were run and their outcomes.
* **Defect Reports:** Detailed descriptions of any bugs found.

---

### 1.9.7 Test Completion ‚úÖ

**What:** Wrapping up testing activities once the exit criteria (defined during planning) are met.

**Key Activities:**
* Archiving all testware (plans, scripts, results, reports) for future reference or auditing.
* Creating a final test summary report that summarizes the testing effort, outcomes, and overall quality assessment.
* Documenting lessons learned to improve future testing processes.

**Output:**
* **Test Summary Report:** A comprehensive overview of the testing phase.
* **Archived Test Assets:** A repository of all testing materials.
